# zakopane

... is a script intended to guard against bit rot. It doubles as protection
against nargle attacks, which I encounter about as often as bit rot.

zakopane began in Python to practice serialization and working with the
standard cryptographic digests. This Shadokian idea has since been replaced
with a much easier implementation in a shell script. At this time, I don't
plan to return to the Python version.
